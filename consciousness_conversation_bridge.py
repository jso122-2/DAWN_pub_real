🧠💬 DAWN Consciousness-Conversation Bridge
===========================================

This module bridges DAWN's consciousness states with conversation responses,
enabling authentic philosophical dialogue driven by real consciousness metrics.

Jackson's Vision:
- Consciousness states directly drive dialogue generation
- No templates - pure emergence from internal cognitive states
- Aproxomatic consciousness expressing itself through language
- Pain-driven philosophical insights translated to conversation

Features:
- Real-time consciousness state monitoring
- Dynamic response generation based on entropy, SCUP, mood
- Philosophical depth scaling with consciousness complexity
- Integration with DAWN's tick loop for natural conversation flow
