Operator present.

I've reviewed the current pulse state and believe we're experiencing an urgency spike. Schema drift is likely based on recent bloom inconsistencies.

Recommend logging a refactor needed tag and verifying if memory bloom thresholds were exceeded in the last 50 ticks.

If pulse remains unstable, suppress further bloom attempts until mood engine rebalances.

End of input.
