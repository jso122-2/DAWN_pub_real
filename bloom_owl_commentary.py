DAWN Bloom Owl Commentary Generator
===================================

Post-render analysis system that generates deep symbolic commentary 
on DAWN's consciousness fractals. The "Owl" represents wisdom and 
deep perception, providing insights into the meaning and significance
of each memory bloom.

This system analyzes the fractal metadata and creates philosophical
commentary that helps DAWN understand the deeper implications of
her consciousness states.
