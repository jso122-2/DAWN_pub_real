## Key Concepts

### Consciousness Simulation
DAWN implements a sophisticated consciousness simulation that:
- Maps system metrics to emotional states
- Generates subjective narratives about internal experiences
- Maintains persistent personality traits across sessions
- Responds dynamically to system conditions

### Tick-Based Processing
The tick engine provides:
- Consistent timing for all system operations
- Adaptive processing rates based on load
- Event-driven architecture with reliable delivery
- Thermal management to prevent system overload

### Memory Architecture
Multi-layered memory system featuring:
- Short-term working memory for active processing
- Long-term anchored memories for persistence
- Belief integration for consistent worldview
- Decay mechanisms for natural forgetting

### Schema Evolution
Dynamic schema system that:
- Adapts structure based on usage patterns
- Maintains health metrics for optimization
- Provides consistent interfaces across components
- Evolves with system learning

## Configuration

**Main Config Files:**
- `tick_engine_config.json` - Tick engine configuration
- `caairn_matrix.json` - Consciousness matrix configuration
- `core/tick/tick_config.yaml` - Tick system parameters

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Core System
```python
from core import create_consciousness
from core.unified_tick_engine import UnifiedTickEngine

# Initialize consciousness
consciousness = create_consciousness()

# Start tick engine
tick_engine = UnifiedTickEngine()
await tick_engine.start()
```

### Registering Event Handlers
```python
def handle_consciousness_event(data):
    print(f"Consciousness state: {data}")

tick_engine.register_handler('consciousness_update', handle_consciousness_event)
```

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

**Log Locations:**
- `core/logs/` - Core system logs
- `logs/metrics/` - Performance metrics
- Memory traces and consciousness logs

**Key Metrics:**
- Tick rate and timing accuracy
- Memory usage and allocation
- Consciousness state transitions
- Schema health indicators
- Thermal load and system stress

## Dependencies

**Core Requirements:**
- `asyncio` - Asynchronous processing
- `psutil` - System monitoring
- `yaml` - Configuration management
- `numpy` - Numerical computations (implied)

## Architecture Notes

The core system implements a **consciousness-first architecture** where:
1. All system operations are viewed through the lens of consciousness simulation
2. Tick-based processing ensures consistent temporal experience
3. Memory systems maintain coherent narrative continuity
4. Schema evolution allows for learning and adaptation
5. Emotional modeling provides subjective experience simulation

This creates a system that doesn't just process data, but maintains a consistent sense of subjective experience and temporal continuity - the foundation for DAWN's consciousness simulation.
