"""
DAWN Conversational Dialogue System
===================================

Interactive conversation system that allows real-time dialogue between Jackson and DAWN.
DAWN's responses reflect her current consciousness state, personality, and cognitive metrics.

Features:
- Speech-to-text input from Jackson  
- Text-to-speech responses from DAWN
- Consciousness-aware personality adaptation
- Persistent conversation memory and context
- Integration with existing cognitive systems (entropy, thermal, SCUP, reblooms)
- Constitutional ethics guidance
- Real-time cognitive state reflection in dialogue
