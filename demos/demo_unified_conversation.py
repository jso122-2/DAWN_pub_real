DAWN Unified Conversation System Demo
====================================

Demonstration of the unified conversation system with dynamic, 
consciousness-driven language generation across all modes.

This demo showcases:
- Dynamic language generation without templates
- Mode switching with authentic expressions
- Consciousness-driven responses
- Voice synthesis integration
- Session management
