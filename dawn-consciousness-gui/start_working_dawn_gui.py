"""
Working DAWN GUI Startup Script
================================

This script uses the PROVEN mmap system that already works:
1. Consciousness Writer - Creates ../runtime/dawn_consciousness.mmap 
2. MMap Backend Server (port 8080) - Reads mmap, serves via HTTP
3. GUI Frontend Server (port 3000) - Serves interface, proxies to backend

Uses existing working logic, no complex imports!
