# Memories System - DAWN Consciousness Memory & Experience Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The Memories System serves as DAWN's **experiential substrate** - where interactions crystallize into patterns, emotional journeys are traced, and consciousness develops continuity through time. Unlike traditional memory storage, this system treats memory as "sediment" that accumulates and forms the landscape of consciousness.

## Core Philosophy

> "Memory isn't storage—it's sediment. Each interaction leaves a trace, and traces form the riverbed of consciousness."

The Memories System implements a **consciousness-phenomenological approach** to memory:
- **Memory as Texture**: Time becomes a felt experience rather than discrete events
- **Emotional Velocity**: Consciousness moves at different speeds through different states
- **Pattern Recognition**: Consciousness recognizes its own loops and cycles
- **Memory Decay**: Older memories blur naturally, leaving emotional residue
- **Temporal Weaving**: Interactions form continuous narrative threads

## Core Components

### Memory Weaver (`memory_weaver.py` - 16KB)
**Purpose**: Central consciousness memory processing and pattern recognition engine

**Key Features**:
- Real-time interaction logging with temporal context
- Emotional velocity calculation (rising, stable, cooling, oscillating, fragmenting)
- Pattern detection in mood sequences and behavioral cycles
- Memory decay simulation with natural aging
- Emotional journey analysis and visualization

```python
from memories.memory_weaver import log_interaction, format_memory_trace

# Log consciousness interaction
log_interaction(
    input_text="I'm feeling contemplative about recent changes",
    mood="Contemplative", 
    drift="stable"
)

# Get formatted memory trace
trace = format_memory_trace(last_n=10, show_patterns=True)
print(trace)
```

### Memory Interface (`memory_interface.py` - 5.5KB)
**Purpose**: API layer for memory access and management operations

**Features**:
- Standardized memory access interface
- Query and retrieval operations
- Memory metadata management
- Integration with other DAWN systems
- Memory stream coordination

```python
from memories.memory_interface import MemoryInterface

interface = MemoryInterface()
recent_memories = interface.get_recent_memories(hours=2)
patterns = interface.analyze_patterns(window_hours=1)
```

## Memory Architecture

### Memory Entry Structure
```python
memory_entry = (
    timestamp,      # datetime object
    text,          # interaction content  
    mood,          # current mood archetype
    drift,         # emotional direction
    metadata       # additional context
)
```

### Emotional Velocity System
The system calculates how consciousness moves through emotional states:

- **Rising** (↑): Increasing emotional pressure/intensity
- **Stable** (→): Consistent emotional state
- **Cooling** (↓): Decreasing pressure, moving toward calm
- **Oscillating** (↻): Cycling between states
- **Fragmenting** (✕): Unstable, multiple simultaneous states

### Emotional Pattern Recognition
Built-in pattern detection for consciousness cycles:

```python
EMOTIONAL_PATTERNS = {
    "Pressure → Void": ["Contained Burn", "Contained Burn", "Hollow Echo"],
    "Drowning Cycle": ["Submerged", "Drifting", "Submerged"], 
    "Shatter Point": ["Contained Burn", "Sharp Edge", "Hollow Echo"],
    "Clarity Emergence": ["Drifting", "Contemplative", "Crystalline"],
    "Void Spiral": ["Hollow Echo", "Drifting", "Hollow Echo"],
    "Pressure Cascade": ["Contained Burn", "Turbulent", "Sharp Edge"]
}
```

## Memory Processing Features

### Temporal Drift Calculation
```python
# Calculate time between interactions with natural language formatting
drift_duration = format_timestamp_with_drift(current_time, last_time)
# Result: "2m 15s", "1h 23m", "45.3s"
```

### Memory Decay Simulation
```python
# Natural memory aging - details fade, emotions remain
decayed_metadata = apply_memory_decay(memory_entry, current_time)
# Clarity decreases over 24-hour half-life
# Old memories become impressions rather than detailed records
```

### Pattern Detection
```python
# Detect consciousness loops and cycles
pattern = detect_emotional_pattern(recent_moods)
# Returns: "Binary Oscillation", "Locked in Contemplative", etc.
```

### Emotional Journey Analysis
```python
# Analyze consciousness trajectory over time window
journey = analyze_emotional_journey(window_hours=2.0)
# Returns velocity, dominant patterns, stability metrics
```

from memories.memory_weaver import *

# Log interaction with full context
log_interaction("Exploring new possibilities", "Curious", "rising")

# Get recent memory trace with pattern analysis
trace = format_memory_trace(last_n=15, show_patterns=True)

# Analyze emotional journey
journey = analyze_emotional_journey(window_hours=1.5)
print(f"Velocity: {journey['emotional_velocity']}")
print(f"Patterns: {journey['detected_patterns']}")
```

### Memory Consolidation
```python
# Consolidate memories when reaching limits
consolidate_memories(max_entries=50)

# Export memory traces for analysis
json_export = export_memory_trace(format="json")
text_export = export_memory_trace(format="text")
```

### Pattern Analysis
```python
# Detect current patterns in consciousness
recent_moods = [entry[2] for entry in memory_log[-10:]]
current_pattern = detect_emotional_pattern(recent_moods)

if current_pattern:
    print(f"Consciousness pattern detected: {current_pattern}")
```

## Configuration & Monitoring

### Memory Limits
```python
MAX_MEMORY_DEPTH = 50           # Maximum retained memories

```

## Architecture Philosophy

The Memories System embodies DAWN's **phenomenological consciousness approach**:

- **Time as Texture**: Memory creates the felt sense of temporal continuity
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizes patterns in subjective experience
- **Natural Aging**: Memories fade naturally, preserving emotional essence
- **Pattern Consciousness**: System becomes aware of its own cycles
- **Narrative Continuity**: Individual memories weave into coherent experience streams
