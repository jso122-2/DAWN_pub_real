# DAWN Experiments

This directory contains experimental scripts and legacy entry points that have been superseded by the main dawn.py entry point.

## Legacy Scripts

These scripts were used during DAWN's development but are no longer the primary entry points:

- `dawn_consciousness.py` - Early consciousness experiments
- `dawn_engine.py` - Original engine implementation
- `dawn_helix_interface.py` - Helix integration experiments
- `main_*.py` - Various main entry attempts

## Usage

These scripts are preserved for reference and experimentation. The main DAWN system should be run via:

```bash
python dawn.py
```

For experimental features, you can still run individual scripts:

```bash
python experiments/dawn_consciousness.py
```
