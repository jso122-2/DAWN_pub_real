Memory hits: Multiple successful retrievals
Memory persistence: 3 memories saved/loaded successfully
Integration tests: All passing
Error rate: 0% (no errors during testing)
```

## 🔧 Key Features Working

### 1. **Automatic Memory Capture**
```python
# System automatically captures these events:
- Claude query events → stored as memories
- Mood changes → stored with sigil "MOOD_SHIFT"
- Entropy spikes → stored with "ENTROPY_SPIKE", "STABILIZE_PROTOCOL"
- Thermal events → stored with "THERMAL_EVENT"
- Sigil activations → stored with specific sigil names
```

### 2. **Rich Memory Metadata**
```json
{
  "memory_id": "chunk_1737746085_a1b2c3d4",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:54:45",
  "speaker": "dawn.core",
  "topic": "system_event",
  "content": "System entropy stabilized after fluctuation period",
  "pulse_state": {
    "entropy": 0.45,
    "heat": 23.7,
    "scup": 0.72,
    "mood": "stable",
    "zone": "calm"
  },
  "sigils": ["STABILIZE_PROTOCOL"]
}
```

### 3. **Intelligent Routing**
- High importance memories → Working memory (50 item limit)
- All memories → Recent memory (200 item limit)
- Significant memories → Long-term storage
- Importance calculated from entropy, heat, SCUP, sigils, speaker

### 4. **Advanced Retrieval**
- Content keyword matching
- Pulse state filtering (entropy, heat, mood ranges)
- Sigil-based filtering
- Speaker and topic filtering
- Relevance scoring with recency bonus

## 🚀 Ready for Production Use

The memory routing system is now:

✅ **Fully Integrated** - Works seamlessly with DAWN consciousness  
✅ **Tested** - All functionality verified through comprehensive tests  
✅ **Persistent** - JSON Lines storage for memory preservation

1. **Capture Interactions** - Every Claude query, user interaction, and system event
2. **Preserve Context** - Full pulse state (entropy, heat, SCUP, mood) with each memory
3. **Link Symbols** - Connect memories to active sigils for thematic grouping
4. **Route Intelligently** - Important memories prioritized for quick retrieval
5. **Save Persistently** - Auto-save to JSON Lines files every 5 minutes
6. **Enable Retrieval** - Search memories by content, context, or metadata
7. **Track Performance** - Monitor memory system health and usage patterns

## 🎯 Next Steps

The system is production-ready, but potential enhancements include:

- 📊 Memory analytics dashboard
- 🤖 Semantic similarity search using embeddings
- 🧠 Memory consolidation and summarization
