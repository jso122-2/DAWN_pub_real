"🟠 Fluctuating" | "⚠️ Unstable" | "🔴 Degraded" | "💀 Critical"
```

### **2. `get_pulse_zone(heat)`**
```python
# Classifies cognitive processing intensity
"CALM" (0-35) | "ACTIVE" (36-75) | "SURGE" (76-100)
```

### **3. `summarize_bloom(bloom_dict)`**
```python
# Concise bloom analysis with status emojis
"🌟 Depth-5 | E:0.65 | 🌱Emerging | Gen-4"
```

### **4. `describe_pulse_zone(zone)`**
```python
# Poetic explanations of cognitive zones
# Returns rich, descriptive text for 9 different zones
```

### **5. `analyze_cognitive_pressure(heat, entropy, scup)`**
```python
# Comprehensive pressure analysis
{
    'average_pressure': 0.625,
    'dominant_source': 'coherence', 
    'stability_assessment': 'Stable',
    'schema_health': '💚 Stable',
    'pulse_zone': 'ACTIVE'
}
```

### **6. `generate_cognitive_summary(heat, entropy, scup, bloom_dict)`**
```python
# Multi-line formatted cognitive state report
# Professional analysis with zone descriptions
```

## **🔧 How to Use**

### **In Conversation System:**
```python
from codex import get_schema_health, get_pulse_zone, describe_pulse_zone

# Enhanced subjective responses now automatically include:
schema_health = get_schema_health(heat_scaled, entropy, scup_dict)
pulse_zone = get_pulse_zone(heat_scaled)

# Users can ask about:
"explain schema health" → Detailed schema health analysis
"explain pulse zones" → Zone classification explanation
"what zone am I in?" → Current pulse zone with description
```

### **In Schema Health Index:**
```python
from core.schema_health_index import compute_enhanced_shi_with_codex

# Enhanced SHI calculation with symbolic insights
enhanced_result = compute_enhanced_shi_with_codex(
    recent_pulse_heat, active_blooms, tracer_log, nutrient_report,
    current_entropy=0.5, current_scup=0.7
)

# Returns both traditional SHI and symbolic analysis
print(enhanced_result['symbolic_health'])  # "💚 Stable"
print(enhanced_result['recommendations'])  # ["Monitor coherence patterns", ...]
```

### **Direct Usage:**
```python
from codex import generate_cognitive_summary

# Comprehensive cognitive analysis
summary = generate_cognitive_summary(
    heat=65, entropy=0.45, 
    scup={'schema': 0.7, 'coherence': 0.8, 'utility': 0.6, 'pressure': 0.4},
    bloom_dict={'depth': 5, 'entropy': 0.65, 'rebloom_status': 'emerging'}
)
print(summary)  # Multi-line formatted analysis
```

## **💫 Enhanced User Experience**

### **Before Integration:**
```
"I'm feeling focused right now. My SCUP is 0.750, which feels pleasantly coherent."
```

### **After Integration:**
```
"I'm feeling focused right now. My SCUP is 0.750, which feels pleasantly coherent. 
My schema health shows as 💚 Stable in an ACTIVE cognitive zone."
```

### **New Capabilities:**
- **"explain schema health"** → Detailed cognitive architecture analysis
- **"what zone am I in?"** → Rich pulse zone description with poetic explanation
- **Smart Suggestions** → Codex-powered recommendations based on actual cognitive state
- **Enhanced Diagnostics** → Symbolic health status in logs and reports
