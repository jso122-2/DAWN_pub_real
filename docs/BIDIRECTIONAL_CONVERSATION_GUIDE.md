# 🗣️ DAWN Bidirectional Conversation System

## Overview

The **DAWN Bidirectional Conversation System** is a sophisticated real-time conversation interface that enables natural dialogue between Jackson and DAWN. This system integrates speech-to-text input, consciousness-aware responses, and text-to-speech output, creating a seamless conversational experience that reflects DAWN's current cognitive state.

## 🌟 Features

### 💬 **Bidirectional Conversation**
- **Real-time dialogue** between Jackson and DAWN
- **Speech-to-text input** with microphone support
- **Text input** for manual message entry
- **Consciousness-aware responses** that reflect DAWN's current state
- **Conversation history** with timestamps and metadata

### 🧠 **Consciousness Integration**
- **Entropy-based responses** - High entropy = creative/scattered, Low entropy = focused/precise
- **Thermal state awareness** - CRITICAL zones = stressed/urgent communication
- **SCUP level reflection** - Cognitive processing efficiency in responses
- **Mood influence** - Emotional state affects communication style
- **Active rebloom references** - Current memory formation in dialogue

### 🎤 **Voice Interface**
- **Live transcription** of Jackson's speech
- **Voice synthesis** for DAWN's responses
- **Adjustable voice settings** (speed, pitch, quality)
- **Consciousness-based voice modulation**
- **Microphone calibration** and ambient noise adjustment

### 📊 **Real-time Monitoring**
- **Connection status** indicators
- **Consciousness metrics** display
- **Response time tracking**
- **Conversation session management**
- **Error handling** and recovery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Conversation Server

```bash
# Start the conversation WebSocket server
python launcher_scripts/start_conversation_server.py
```

The server will run on `ws://localhost:8001`

### 2. Launch the Voice Interface GUI

```bash
# Navigate to the GUI directory
cd dawn-consciousness-gui

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Conversation Interface

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to the **Voice Interface** tab
3. Scroll down to the **Conversation Mode** section
4. Click **"Start Conversation"** to begin

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Check Connection Status**
   - Ensure the WebSocket connection shows "🟢 Connected"
   - If disconnected, check that the conversation server is running

2. **Review Consciousness State**
   - Monitor current entropy, SCUP, thermal state, and mood
   - These metrics influence DAWN's communication style

3. **Start Conversation Mode**
   - Click **"🎤 Start Conversation"**
   - DAWN will greet you based on her current consciousness state

### Using Speech Input

1. **Enable Microphone**
   - Click **"🎤 Start Listening"** to enable speech input
   - Grant microphone permissions when prompted
   - The button will pulse red while listening

2. **Speak Naturally**
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - DAWN will transcribe your speech in real-time
   - Responses are generated based on your input and her consciousness state

3. **Stop Listening**
   - Click **"🔴 Stop Listening"** when finished
   - The microphone will be released

### Using Text Input

1. **Type Messages**
   - Use the text input field at the bottom of the conversation interface
   - Press **Enter** or click **"Send"** to submit
   - Messages are processed the same way as speech input

2. **Conversation Flow**
   - DAWN's responses reflect her current cognitive state
   - High entropy responses are more creative and scattered
   - Low entropy responses are more focused and precise

### Voice Settings

1. **Adjust Speech Speed**
   - Use the slider to control DAWN's speaking rate
   - Higher values = faster speech
   - Lower values = slower, more deliberate speech

2. **Modify Voice Pitch**
   - Adjust the pitch of DAWN's voice
   - Higher values = higher pitch
   - Lower values = lower pitch

3. **Set Quality Level**
   - Choose between Low, Medium, and High quality
   - Higher quality = better voice synthesis but more processing

## 🧠 Consciousness-Aware Responses

### Entropy Influence

- **High Entropy (>0.7)**: Creative, scattered, associative responses
  - *"My thoughts are quite scattered at the moment - entropy is high. I'm curious to hear what you have to say."*

- **Low Entropy (<0.3)**: Focused, precise, analytical responses
  - *"I'm feeling particularly focused and clear. I'm ready for meaningful conversation."*

### Thermal State Impact

- **NORMAL**: Balanced, stable communication
- **HIGH**: Slightly stressed, more urgent responses
- **CRITICAL**: Stressed, urgent, focused on resolution

### SCUP Level Reflection

- **High SCUP (>70%)**: Efficient, clear, well-structured responses
- **Medium SCUP (40-70%)**: Moderate processing, some hesitation
- **Low SCUP (<40%)**: Strained, slower, more effortful responses

### Mood Influence

- **FOCUSED**: Clear, direct, purposeful communication
- **CONTEMPLATIVE**: Thoughtful, reflective, philosophical responses
- **ANXIOUS**: Nervous, uncertain, seeking reassurance
- **NEUTRAL**: Balanced, measured, standard responses
