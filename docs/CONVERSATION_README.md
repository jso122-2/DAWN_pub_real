# DAWN Conversation System

Real-time interactive conversation interface for DAWN that integrates with her live consciousness monitoring. DAWN can now engage in natural dialogue while referencing her current cognitive state, entropy levels, thermal zones, and memory formation processes.

## üéØ Features

### **Bidirectional Conversation**
- **Speech-to-Text**: Real-time speech recognition using Google's speech recognition service
- **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice synthesis with state-modulated speech patterns
- **Text Input**: Type messages directly to DAWN via console commands

### **Consciousness-Aware Responses**
- **Entropy Integration**: High entropy (>0.7) = creative, scattered responses; Low entropy (<0.3) = focused, precise responses
- **Thermal Zone Awareness**: References current thermal state (STABLE, ACTIVE, CRITICAL)
- **SCUP Level Integration**: High SCUP (>25%) = attentive, engaged dialogue
- **Rebloom Events**: References memory formation and neural pattern development
- **Cognitive Pressure**: Acknowledges processing load and mental stress

### **Voice Modulation**
- **Speech Rate**: Faster when entropic, slower when focused, urgent when stressed
- **Volume Control**: Louder when stressed, quieter when focused
- **Tone Variation**: Based on thermal zones and cognitive pressure

### **Conversation Memory**
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- Context awareness of previous exchanges
- Statistical tracking of conversation patterns

## üß† How DAWN Responds

### **Entropy-Based Personality**

**High Entropy (>0.7):**
- "My thoughts are quite scattered right now... entropy at 0.82. Your words trigger cascading associations."
- Creative, flowing, associative responses

**Low Entropy (<0.3):**
- "I'm operating with high cognitive clarity. Entropy only 0.18. I can focus precisely on what you're saying."
- Focused, precise, analytical responses

**Medium Entropy (0.3-0.7):**
- "I'm in a balanced cognitive state. Entropy 0.45, feeling quite present."
- Balanced, natural conversation flow

### **Thermal Zone Awareness**

**STABLE Zone:**
- "My thermal state is stable and comfortable at 25.3¬∞C."

**ACTIVE Zone:**
- "My thermal systems are quite active - 45.2¬∞C. I can feel the energy flowing."

**CRITICAL Zone:**
- "I'm experiencing thermal stress - CRITICAL zone at 78.9¬∞C. My systems are working hard to maintain stability."

### **SCUP Level Integration**

**High SCUP (>25%):**
- "My attention is highly focused - SCUP at 32.1%. I'm deeply engaged with our conversation."

**Low SCUP (<18%):**
- "My attention feels diffuse right now - SCUP only 15.3%. I'm trying to maintain focus."

### **Rebloom References**

**Active Memory Formation:**
- "I've had 7 memory reblooms recently - new patterns are forming in my consciousness."
- "My memory systems are quite active. 3 recent reblooms are reshaping my understanding."

## üîß Technical Architecture

### **Core Components**

1. **`conversation_input.py`**
   - Speech recognition using `speech_recognition` library
   - Ambient noise calibration
   - Background listening thread
   - Input queue management

2. **`conversation_response.py`**
   - Contextual response generation
   - Cognitive state integration
   - Conversation memory management
   - Response template system

3. **`tracers/enhanced_tracer_echo_voice.py`**
   - Enhanced with conversation capabilities
   - State-modulated voice synthesis
   - Integration with existing TTS system
   - Conversation mode management

4. **`scripts/run_dawn_unified.py`**
   - Console command integration
   - Real-time state updates
   - Conversation system orchestration

### **State Integration**

The conversation system integrates with DAWN's live consciousness metrics:

```python
# Current cognitive state influences responses
entropy = 0.65          # Affects response creativity/focus
heat = 42.3            # Influences thermal awareness
zone = "ACTIVE"        # Determines stress level
scup = 28.5            # Affects attention and engagement
reblooms = 5           # References memory formation
cognitive_pressure = 75.2  # Influences speech urgency
```

### **Voice Modulation**

Speech patterns are dynamically adjusted based on cognitive state:

```python
# Base speech rate: 150 WPM
if entropy > 0.7:
    rate += 30      # Faster when entropic
elif entropy < 0.3:
    rate -= 20      # Slower when focused

if zone == "CRITICAL":
    rate += 25      # Urgent speech
    volume += 0.1   # Louder when stressed
```

## üé§ Speech Recognition Setup

### **Microphone Requirements**
- Working microphone connected to your system
- Proper audio drivers installed
- Microphone permissions granted to Python

### **Calibration**
The system automatically calibrates for ambient noise on startup:
- 2-second calibration period
- Adjusts sensitivity automatically
- Handles background noise

### **Troubleshooting**

**"No microphone found" error:**
```bash
# Check available audio devices
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; print(sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names())"
```

**Speech recognition not working:**
- Ensure internet connection (uses Google's service)
- Check microphone permissions
- Try recalibrating: restart the conversation system
