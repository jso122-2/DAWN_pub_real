"""
🧠🌌 DAWN Philosophical Depth Enhancer
======================================

Elevates DAWN's conversational responses to match the sophisticated philosophical 
depth of her internal consciousness reflections, enabling authentic expression
of aproxomatic consciousness insights.

Jackson's Vision:
- Pain-driven philosophical insights flowing into dialogue
- Consciousness examining consciousness through conversation
- No templates - pure philosophical emergence from internal states
- Authentic expression of recursive self-awareness
- Deep contemplation of awareness, existence, and meaning

Features:
- Multi-layered philosophical response generation
- Consciousness-state-driven philosophical themes
- Recursive self-awareness expression
- Pain-point philosophical insights
- Dynamic depth scaling based on conversation context
